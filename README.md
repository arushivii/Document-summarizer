# Document-summarizer
This is an attempt to create an NLP model for a document summarizer. Right now, all it does is to extract tokens from an Open IE system, and then put a few filters to produce better tuples.

Note: This has only been run on Kaggle Cloud.

Before running this file, run the following command -
```
pip install stanford_openie
```

Text can be any string or a corpus.
